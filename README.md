**Run 32-bit Android apps on 64-bit-only ARM phones.**
An open-source ARM32 -> ARM64 native code translator and app launcher.

[Читать на русском](README.ru.md)

---

A growing number of recent phone SoCs (for example the Snapdragon 8 Elite) have no AArch32
execution state at all. Old apps that ship only `armeabi` / `armeabi-v7a` native libraries
cannot start on them, and there is no hardware fallback.

ZettaBridge runs such an app **inside its own process**:
- the app's Java/Kotlin code runs natively on the phone's normal 64-bit ART;
- only the app's 32-bit native code is translated to AArch64.

No root, no custom ROM, no system image changes.

> **Status: early development.** Not usable by end users yet. See [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## Orange Roulette, a 2014 armeabi game, on a phone with no 32-bit CPU

|---|---|---|

Every pixel above was drawn by translated 32-bit ARM code: a OnePlus 13 (Snapdragon 8 Elite) has
no AArch32 execution state, so the game cannot start on it at all without ZettaBridge.

## How it works

```
ZettaBridge launcher (arm64 app)
 |
 +-- imports an APK as a plugin, pins a home-screen shortcut (nothing is installed)
 +-- :guest process
      +-- plugin Java code on the real 64-bit ART
      +-- libzbridge.so (arm64)
           +-- Dynarmic: A32/T32 -> AArch64 JIT, 4 GiB guest address space
           +-- syscall layer: 32-bit Linux ABI -> 64-bit kernel
           +-- guest threads, signals, "carrier" threads for Java callers
           +-- JNI bridge: a synthesized 32-bit JNIEnv / JavaVM
      +-- real arm32 Android system libraries (linker, libc, libm, libc++, ...)
```

- **Native code is translated by [Dynarmic](https://github.com/Vita3K/dynarmic)**
  (0BSD), an ARM dynamic recompiler, with a small local patch for ARMv8 Thumb-2 opcodes.
- **The guest runs the real arm32 bionic.** The Android linker, libc and friends come from
  an AOSP system image. ZettaBridge translates Linux syscalls, not libc functions.
- **Java <-> native goes through a JNI bridge.**
  - `System.loadLibrary` on a 32-bit library loads a tiny arm64 proxy instead.
  - The proxy binds the guest's `Java_*` exports and runs its `JNI_OnLoad`.
  - Guest native code talks to Java through a synthesized 32-bit `JNIEnv`.
- **Old native libraries are fixed up at import.** Text relocations and absolute
  `DT_NEEDED` paths are rewritten, because modern Android linkers refuse them.

## What works today

- **Translator core.** On aarch64 Linux via `zbrun`, and on a real phone both in Termux and
  inside an app process next to ART:
  - static and dynamic arm32 Android executables through the real arm32 linker;
  - threads, signals, C++ exceptions, `dlopen`, kernel user helpers.
- **Launcher.** Imports APKs as plugins with home-screen shortcuts. 64-bit apps already run
  as plugins, including apps with Firebase/AdMob, Jetpack Compose and Flutter.
- **JNI bridge.** Implemented and tested against a mock JVM on the host:
  - guest `JNIEnv`/`JavaVM`;
  - Java -> guest native calls from multiple Java threads;
  - `RegisterNatives`;
  - library loading and `Java_*` binding.
- **GLES 2.0 and 3.0 passthrough, EGL and ANativeWindow.** Guests create their own GL context
  on their own thread; ~490 entry points are generated from the Khronos registry.
- **Games running on the phone.**
  - *Orange Roulette* (2014, Haxe/OpenFL): menus and gameplay, with sound.
  - *Flappy Bird* (AndEngine): playable.
  - A modern Flutter app starts, runs its Dart code, presents frames and takes touch input,
    though rendering is not yet complete.

Not supported yet: `NativeActivity` (so Unity and pure-NDK guests do not start), Vulkan, and
anything that needs a real package installation.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | What it brings |
|---|---|
| **v0.1** | 32-bit apps whose native libraries do not draw on their own: utilities and apps using old native libs for crypto, image processing, parsers, databases. |
| **v0.2** | OpenGL ES passthrough and Android assets: simple 2D games, starting with Orange Roulette. |
| **v0.3+** | 3D games and performance work: GL call batching, faster floating point, JNI fast paths |
| exploring | x86 / x86_64 guests through [Box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64) |

## Honest limits

- **Speed.** Translated code runs slower than native: roughly 2x for integer code and
  3.5x for memory copies on a Snapdragon 8 Elite, more for floating-point-heavy loops.
- **3D games are harder, not off-limits.** Every call from the app into the system, and
  OpenGL ES calls in particular, crosses a translation boundary, so 3D-heavy games will be
  slow at first. Making them playable is a goal. Planned work:
  - batching GL calls;
  - faster floating point;
  - host-side JNI fast paths.
- **Apps that need a real installation are out of scope:** their own UID and
  permissions, visibility to other apps, accounts, push notifications.
- **Some apps refuse to run inside another app on purpose** (Play Integrity / clone
  detection). These are not worked around.

## Building (development)

Requirements:
- aarch64 Linux, clang, CMake, Ninja;
- Boost headers;
- Android NDK r29.

```
git submodule update --init; git -C third_party/dynarmic apply ../patches/dynarmic-0001-thumb32-armv8.patch ../patches/dynarmic-0002-asimd-narrowing.patch
```
```
cmake -S . -B build/host -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++; ninja -C build/host
```
```
tools/extract_sysroot.sh; tools/build_guest.sh; ctest --test-dir build/host; tools/run_guest_tests.sh
```

`tools/extract_sysroot.sh` downloads an AOSP GSI (about 1.2 GB) and extracts the arm32
system libraries into `sysroot/`. The Android build of `libzbridge.so` and the launcher are
described in `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/`.

## Supporting the project

ZettaBridge is written by one person. If it runs an app you needed, [Boosty](https://boosty.to/zailox)
keeps the work going.

## Contributing

The project is young. The most useful contributions right now are issues that name
old 32-bit apps you want to run. Include the app name and version, where the APK comes
from, and what happens.

## License

ZettaBridge is **source-available, not open source**. Two licences apply cumulatively (see
[LICENSE](LICENSE)): **PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0** and **PolyForm Perimeter 1.0.1**. Read it,
change it, share it for noncommercial purposes. What both together forbid: making money from it,
and providing others a competing product - a competing product counts even when it is free.

Commercial use of any kind - selling it, shipping it inside a product, preinstalling it in a
device ROM - needs a separate licence from the author, which is available on request.

Third-party code keeps its own licence; see `third_party/README.md`. Dynarmic is 0BSD and the
